 This is a basic calculator that has the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The UI design was inspired by modern calculators which are used mainly on phones.
  Each value, operation , result and the fontSize are updated using state. Commas are automatically added to improve users experience while using this calculator.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations:</h1>
 Currently this application has multiple event handlers performing tasks so my focus will be to implement useReducer() to consolidate all neccessary state. This app currently doesn't have a login that's my next focus. Then my will shift to a more mobile approach utiltizing React Native.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Lessons Learned:</h1>
 Lessons that were learned was to avoid contradicting state and redundant state. To always keep track of how state is being rendered and to always setState.
 Also take advantage of React's hooks when updating state throughout my applications.
